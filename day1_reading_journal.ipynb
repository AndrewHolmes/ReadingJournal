    "The video on complex behaviors in computer animation is interesting because it demonstrates a level of intelligence in virtual objects. The way the video explains how the animated objects interact with their environment reminds me of a real-world robot learning to interact with its surroundings. With robotics, you are programming a mechanical creation to interact with its environment, but with the animated figure, you are programming something to interact with the environment that you programmed. I still found the video's description to be a little vague on how it actually worked, and I think that the animated models could have been more detailed to illustrate more depth."
